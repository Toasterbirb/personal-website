<h1>Void Linux Package Repository</h1>
<hr>
I recently (end of 2021) decided to hop to <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>. One of the things I instantly noticed was that it has way less packages compared to Arch Linux and since the AUR isn't there to fill up the gaps, I had to install some of the software from source. I thought to myself that this was the opportunity to learn how to package software.
<br><br>
This repository contains stuff that I felt like was worth packaging and might be useful. I do not own the rights to everything, but since the software is open source, I felt like I have the right to &quot;distribute&quot; the sources in binary packages per their licenses. To fulfill the requirements of GPLv3, I will link to the sources of the packages and list any changes/patches done to the program, if I'm not the developer of that program.
