<h1>How to contact me</h1>
<hr>
I don't have too many accounts on social media platforms, but you can get in touch with me in a few ways.
<h2>Matrix</h2>
This is probably the easiest one (I actually get a notification). My username there is <strong>@toasterbirb:halogen.city</strong>. You can send me a private message there.
<h2>Email</h2>
You can reach me via this address: <strong>mail@toasterbirb.com</strong>.
<h2>Discord</h2>
This is a tricky one. I have been wanting to get rid of my Discord account for a long time now. While I still do use Discord, I want to minimize it as much as I can. I have been planning on trying to get my account deleted completely at some point and quite possibly start a new account used only for select few Discord servers.

If you can find me on Discord though... Well, you found me
