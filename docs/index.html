<h1>Home Nest</h1>
<hr>
Welcome to my internet property! I usually go by the name of 'ToasterBirb', love birbs (birds) and identify as a computer addict.<br><br>
I have been sitting in front of computers as long as I can remember. The first video game I used to play was <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muumit_ja_Taikurin_hattu">Muumit ja Taikurin hattu</a>. Funny enough as of writing, I'm also the <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/mjth">world record holder</a> of finishing the game as fast as possible.<br><br>
I picked up HTML at 5th grade in elementary school, but actual programming languages came in at 8th grade. The skill of bending computers to fulfill your needs felt awesome. So far I have touched so many programming languages, that I have lost count. The languages that stuck around have mostly been C-based languages like C, C++ and C#. I have also dabbled into some other languages but haven't been able to wrap my head around them. I still remember sitting in some python class writing the assignments in C++, because I just couldn't think straight with the python syntax. If I will ever learn new languages, those will probably be Rust, Go or x86-assembly.
