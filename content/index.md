# Home Nest
---
Welcome to my internet property! I usually go by the name of 'ToasterBirb', love birbs (birds) and identify as a computer addict.<break>

I have been sitting in front of computers as long as I can remember. The first video game I used to play was [Muumit ja Taikurin hattu](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muumit_ja_Taikurin_hattu). Funny enough as of writing, I'm also the [world record holder](https://www.speedrun.com/mjth) of finishing the game as fast as possible.<break>

I picked up HTML at 5th grade in elementary school, but actual programming languages came in at 8th grade. The skill of bending computers to fulfill your needs felt awesome. So far I have touched so many programming languages, that I have lost count. The languages that stuck around have mostly been C-based languages like C, C++ and C#. I have also dabbled into some other languages but haven't been able to wrap my head around them. I still remember sitting in some python class writing the assignments in C++, because I just couldn't think straight with the python syntax. If I will ever learn new languages, those will probably be Rust, Go or x86-assembly.

## Links to internet stuff I have made
I push most of the stuff I make to my [Github](https://github.com/Toasterbirb)
- [**Birb2D**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Birb2D). A small game engine project of mine written in C++. So far I have made a [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Flappy-Birb) clone with it. More information and documentation about the project can be found [here](https://birb2d.toasterbirb.com)
- [**dde**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/dde/tree/dev). "Dynamic desktop environment", a mixture of [suckless](https://suckless.org/) programs, like [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) that I have been trying to combine into one desktop environment that would be simpler to install on a new system.
- [**dsteam**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/dsteam). Dmenu fork for launching steam games from a simple [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)-like menu.
- [**kami-red**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/kami-red). A fork of mine from the well known Minecraft anarchy utility client [kami-blue](https://kamiblue.org/).
- [**This website**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/personal-website). Yes, it is open source. Dig in and see how I'm generating these pages from markdown files with a simple shell script.

It is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, so the uptime might not be quite 24/7
