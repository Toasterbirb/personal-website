# Home Nest
---
Welcome to my internet property! I usually go by the name of 'ToasterBirb', love birbs (birds) and identify as a computer addict.

## Links to internet stuff I have made
- [**Birb2D**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Birb2D). A small game engine project of mine written in C++. So far I have made a [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Flappy-Birb) clone with it. More information and documentation about the project can be found [here](https://birb2d.toasterbirb.com)
- [**dde**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/dde/tree/dev). "Dynamic desktop environment", a mixture of [suckless](https://suckless.org/) programs, like [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) that I have been trying to combine into one desktop environment that would be simpler to install on a new system.
- [**dsteam**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/dsteam). Dmenu fork for launching steam games from a simple [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)-like menu.
- [**kami-red**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/kami-red). A fork of mine from the well known Minecraft anarchy utility client [kami-blue](https://kamiblue.org/).
- [**This website**](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/personal-website). Yes, it is open source. Dig in and see how I'm generating these pages from markdown files with a simple shell script.
